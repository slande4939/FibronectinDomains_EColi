# The Production of Fibronectin Domains Harvested from Escherichia Coli

# ABSTRACT
Fibronectin (FN) is crucial for cell adhesion, growth, migration, and differentiation. Moreover, FN plays a major role in wound healing, blood clotting, embryogenesis, tissue repair, and disrupting diseases such as cancer and fibrosis. The purpose of this research project is to increase the production of fibronectin domains in E. Coli by increasing the concentration of Isopropyl β-D-1- thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) during culture. We test different IPTG concentrations: 0.0, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 milimolar (mM) and culture for 2 hours with a 200 rpm shaking. More fibronectin domains are produced as IPTG concentrations increase. To reiterate, in this research E. Coli produces more 42 KDa FN domains when IPTG concentration is 0.6 and 0.9 mM during induction, and the maximum FN domains produced is at 0.9 mM.

# I. INTRODUCTION
Fibronectin (FN) is important for cell adhesion, growth, migration, and differentiation. Additionally, FN is crucial for wound healing, blood clotting, embryogenesis, tissue repair, and disrupting diseases such as cancer and fi brosis [1]. Dr. Karuri’s labora tory uses FN domains in their research. The purpose of this research project is to increase the production of fibronectin domains in E. Coli by increasing the
concentration of Isop ropyl β D 1 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) during culture. 

# II. METHODS
An overnight E. Coli suspension culture in lysogeny broth a mpicillin (LB Amp)Amp); culture conditions: 37 C and 200 r evolutions p er m inute (rpm) rpm). A 30 minute culture of 1:10 dilution in LB Amp of overnight culture ; culture conditions: 37 °C and 200 Induced protein production by adding 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 mM IPTG , and a solution without IPTG, which is the control. Then, grow for 2 hours at 37 °C
with shaking (200 rpm). Harvest of proteins: Isolation of the bacteria by centrifugation, lysing and resuspension in electrophoresis buffer.

# III. RESULTS
E. Coli produces more FN domains as IPTG concentration is increased.
Maximum FN domains produced is at 0.9 mM IPTG.

# IV. DISCUSSION
In future experiment, will vary induction time and temperature, and revolution speed of bacterial culture.

# V. CONCLUSION
Literature uses 0.3 mM of IPTG during induction. This research shows more FN domains will produce when IPTG concentration is 0.6 and 0.9 mM.
